### External Modifications

Currently, the only permitted external modification for use in runs is
SourceAutoRecord (SAR) on the latest full release or a later pre-release.
If SAR is used in a run then demos are required for the run.

Custom builds of SAR are *not* allowed - only the releases from the official GitHub
repository may be used. Other external modifications, such as game plugins or code
injectors, are not allowed. Runs performed with SAR pre-releases may be retroactively
banned if a pre-release is found to provide some advantage. While unlikely, you
acknowledge that by using a SAR pre-release you are putting your runs at risk. When a
new full release of SAR is made available, there is a grace period of 1 week in which
the previous full release is still allowed.

Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis: if you think you have a legitimate
case for using an external modification which isn't listed here, consult a moderator
for the category you're running.
