IF YOU ARE UNSURE WHETHER A COMMAND OR INPUT METHOD IS ALLOWED, CHECK WITH A MODERATOR FOR YOUR
CATEGORY BEFORE USING IT.

All inputs to the game should come from a standard mouse/keyboard/controller or any combination 
thereof. These input devices should only use standard functionality for these devices when creating 
inputs for the game. Here are some examples that are on the edge but we've noted as legal:

- Freescroll (as typically seen on logitech mice)

- Rebinding a joystick on controller to spam jump

- Analogue inputs from analogue keyboards

- Steam input has some functionality which is allowed and some which is not
