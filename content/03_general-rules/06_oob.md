### OOB

Some categories are marked as "inbounds", which essentially means the player and all
portals and props must stay inbounds at all times. More precisely, we say that the
player, all portal origins, and all prop origins must remain inbounds at all times,
except where the game requires otherwise (e.g. certain level transitions place the
player temporarily OOB).

Exceptions can be made to this rule in accidental cases where the rule is briefly
broken. In particular, if an extreme eye offset from a portal transition causes the
player's eye to momentarily peek OOB, but this is not abused, it would not be grounds
for even a high-level run to be rejected.
