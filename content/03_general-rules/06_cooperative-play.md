### Cooperative Play

In any online cooperative run, both players (not just the host) must provide
appropriate proof for the run. The proof requirements are unaffected for local
splitscreen runs.

The network conditions used in online coop are regulated. Any use of packet loss which
benefits the player is banned. Ping-based advantages, however, are allowed - you may
artificially increase ping through external means, such as a VPN, but *not* through
the `net_fakelag` command. Similarly, `net_fakenoise`, `net_fakejitter`, and
`net_fakeloss` are not allowed under any circumstances.
