### Asset Modifications

We have strict rules regarding which assets are allowed to be changed from their 
defaults during runs, which (unless otherwise specified) are shared across all 
games and categories. These rules vary depending on the kind of asset being modified.

#### General Rules

Any asset modifications are subject to being grounds for the rejection or removal of 
any run on speedrun.com or the cm boards.

When assets are required to be submitted alongside a run, these assets must adhere to 
the TOS of all platforms involved in your submission, including both the site the run 
is submitted to and any sites linked from the submission.

Editing binary files (including .DLL, .EXE, .SO, A.OUT, .DYLIB, or .APP) files which 
are present in the game or Steam directory to modify an asset is not allowed.

Modpacks, which are curated by the moderators, are allowed to be used in runs without
restrictions. These modpacks can be found in the #resources channel of the [P2SR
discord](https://discord.com/invite/hRwE4Zr). Other than modpacks, you can only
modify the assets listed on this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C8lGxwyicsJU29Twrr0Xf8TfvjM6YV4qKjgPpxGtu_0/edit).
