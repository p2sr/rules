### Portal Stories: Mel

#### General

Demos are not recorded in any Mel category, since they cause some maps to break.
SAR or SourceSplit must be used for accurate timing.

#### Timing

- Timing begins on the tick the player gains control in the tram, on the
  `tramstart_relay.EnableRefire` entity input.
- Timing ends on the tick the ending cutscene is activated in Finale, on the
  `soundscape.Kill` entity input.
