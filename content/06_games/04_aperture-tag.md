### Aperture Tag

#### Timing

- Timing begins on the tick the crosshair appears, on the
  `tele_out_shower.Enable` entity input.
- Timing ends on the tick the credits appear, on the `credits_video.PlayMovie`
  entity input.
- Alternatively, for the good ending, timing ends on the tick the elevator door
  closes, on the `ele_exit_door.Close` entity input.
