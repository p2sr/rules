### Portal Revolution

#### General

Portal Revolution does not support SAR. Video recording is the main method
for submitting runs. Demos can be recorded with `demo_autorecord 1` and 
`record demoname` at the start of the run and `stop` at the end of the run

#### Timing

- Timing begins when the crosshair appears.
- Timing ends when the screen fades to white.
