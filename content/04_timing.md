## Timing

Most runs use demo time for timing (the main notable exception is Challenge Mode, which
uses its integrated timer). Even when not recording demos, SAR's timer perfectly
emulates demo timing (except in CM where it emulates the integrated timer), so is
recommended for use most of the time. For video submissions, which are required to have
a timer visible on-screen, the timer HUD from `sar_sr_hud` may be used. Alternatively,
SAR's integrated timer may be linked to external speedrun timers such as LiveSplit or
adrift, and these may be overlaid on the video.

If using pause abuse (in a category where it is allowed), the pauses in question must be
timed. This can be done using `sar_speedrun_time_pauses 1`, or manually with video
evidence.

To ensure the run is not affected by network conditions, cooperative runs are timed
differently. The inter-level timing standard for coop is defined per-game.
